# EXTRACTION-OF-BRAIN-TUMOR-FROM-MRI-IMAGES
The idea behind the project is to implement a strategy to detect brain tumor from the scans obtained via Magnetic resonance imaging using basic Image processing algorithms in Matlab.  The algorithm has two stageS- preprocessing followed by segmentation and morphological operations. It uses adaptive K-means for clustering.
